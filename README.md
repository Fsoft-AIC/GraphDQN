# GSADQL
A Hybrid of GraphSAGE and Deep Q-Learning Algorithm to solve charging scheme optimization problem

This repository stores the implementations and experimental settings of Vuong Dinh An's graduation thesis.
- To run code, see the notebook in "Algorithm" folder. You need to modify the correct path as your mounted Drive on colab.
- To run evaluation (figures presented in the thesis), see the notebook in "Util". You also need to modify the correct path as your mounted Drive on colab.
- To view the dataset, see "Dataset" folder.
